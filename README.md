## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using ISL season wise data of each team to better understand:

1. What factors contribute to being successful in ISL? What separates a playoff team from the rest?
2. How many goals are required to qualify for playoffs?
3. Curious case of FC Goa.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is data folder containing stats of all team by each year in json files. Folder structure is self-explanatory.

There are 2 notebooks available here.

- Teams_Year_Analysis: Combines data for stats for a year into a single csv file.
- ISL overall analysis: Analysis combined data and answer questions mentioned above.

Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pdoongarwal.medium.com/how-to-succeed-in-isl-2541bb4db98c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to ISL for the data.
